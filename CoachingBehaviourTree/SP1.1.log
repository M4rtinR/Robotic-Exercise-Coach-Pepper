INFO:08/12/2022 12:41:05 PM Displaying action Now , we're going to do an exercise called external rotations with the cane. I'll give you some instructions on how to perform this exercise first. So, to do these, grasp the cane with both hands in front of you and bend your arms at 90 degrees at your sides.
INFO:08/12/2022 12:41:16 PM Displaying action The aim of this exercise is to improve your ability to perform external rotations with your shoulders. This is required for many everyday tasks so will help you in your daily life. So from your starting position, try to push the cane outward to your left and right without dropping your arms.
INFO:08/12/2022 12:41:36 PM Displaying action As you do this, your upper body will rotate slightly, but just focus on keeping your arms at a 90 degree angle.
